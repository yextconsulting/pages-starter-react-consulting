/**
 * This is an example of how to create a template that makes use of streams data.
 * The stream data originates from Yext's Knowledge Graph. When a template in
 * concert with a stream is built by the Yext Sites system, a static html page
 * is generated for every corresponding (based on the filter) stream document.
 *
 * Another way to think about it is that a page will be generated using this
 * template for every eligible entity in your Knowledge Graph.
